/**
 * Data types
 * Event property keys must be Strings and property values must, with certain specific exceptions,
 * be scalar values, i.e. String, Boolean, Integer, or Float, or a Date object.
 *
 * Date object
 * When a property value is of type Date, the date and time are both recorded to the second.
 * This can be later used for targeting scenarios.
 * For e.g. if you are recording the time of the flight as an event property,
 * you can send a message to the user just before their flight takes off.
